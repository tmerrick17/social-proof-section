## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

With the HTML basic content provided, worked on:
  - assigning HTML tags and CSS class names using the BEM method
  - used SASS (7-1 file structure, I only needed to use 4 modular folders in tis project)
  - creating variables in SASS for color schemes, fonts, font-sizes, etc
  - adding Google Fonts provided
  - reset CSS to give all browsers a common starting point

Next worked on:
  - building mobile first
  - Figuring out where to use Flex vs Grid (used both)
  - Worked on media query for tablet and desktop individually

Finally worked on:
  - Worked on accessibility features for footer links
  - Clean up file structure with unused folders and files and remove unwanted comments

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS grid-area
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- This was a good review of CSS Grid.  I only used it in the magenta colored cards.  Everything else was easy enough to use Flexbox.  That's the trick.  Knowing when to use Grid and when to use Flexbox.  It was a great challenge.

### Continued development

- I need to continue using more advanced parts of Sass like @mixins and @functions.  @Mixins are tricky to remember to use.  By the time I've typed a couple lines of Sass that are redundant, well I've already typed them.  I need to stop and access before I write some redundant Sass and think, "Should I make a @mixin out of it?".
